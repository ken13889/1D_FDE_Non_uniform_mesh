# 1D_FDE_Non_uniform_mesh
- Language: Matlab

The scripts concern the numerical results in the following paper: 

Multigrid for two-sided fractional differential equations discretized by finite volume elements on graded meshes<br />
by Marco Donatelli, Rolf Krause, Mariarosa Mazza, Ken Trotti.

The scripts discretize the Fractional Diffusion Equation (FDE) over a graded mesh mapped by a function, then build a linear system and finally 
solve it through Multigrid Methods.

Check the MAIN.m file for a list of parameters which can be modified and related comments.
